What are nested sets?
---------------------

Nested sets or [Nested Set Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model) is
a way to effectively store hierarchical data in a relational table. From wikipedia:

> The nested set model is to number the nodes according to a tree traversal,
> which visits each node twice, assigning numbers in the order of visiting, and
> at both visits. This leaves two numbers for each node, which are stored as two
> attributes. Querying becomes inexpensive: hierarchy membership can be tested by
> comparing these numbers. Updating requires renumbering and is therefore expensive.

### Applications

NSM shows good performance when tree is updated rarely. It is tuned to be fast for
getting related nodes. It'is ideally suited for building multi-depth menu or 
categories for shop.

Documentation
-------------

Suppose that we have a model `Category`; a `$node` variable is an instance of that model
and the node that we are manipulating. It can be a fresh model or one from database.

### Relationships

Node has two predefined relationships: `parent` and `children`. They are fully
functional, except for Laravel's `has` due to limitations of the framework.
You can use `hasChildren` or `hasParent` to apply constraints:

```php
$items = Category::hasChildren()->get();
```

### Inserting nodes

Moving and inserting nodes includes several database queries, so __transaction is
automatically started__ when node is saved. It is safe to use global transaction 
if you work with several models.

Another important note is that __structural manipulations are deferred__ until you
hit `save` on model (some methods implicitly call `save` and return boolean result
of the operation).

If model is successfully saved it doesn't mean that node has moved. If your application
depends on whether the node has actually changed its position, use `hasMoved` method:

```php
if ($node->save())
{
    $moved = $node->hasMoved();
}
```

#### Creating a new node

When you just create a node, it will be appended to the end of the tree:

```php
Category::create($attributes);
```

In this case the node is considered a _root_ which means that it doesn't have a parent.

#### Making a root from existing node

```php
// #1 Implicit save
$node->saveAsRoot();

// #2 Explicit save
$node->makeRoot()->save();
```

The node will be appended to the end of the tree.

#### Appending and prepending to the specified parent

If you want to make node a child of other node, you can make it last or first child.

In following examples, `$parent` is some existing node.

There are few ways to append a node:

```php
// #1 Using deferred insert
$node->appendTo($parent)->save();

// #2 Using parent node
$parent->append($node);

// #3 Using parent's children relationship
$parent->children()->create($attributes);

// #5 Using node's parent relationship
$node->parent()->associate($parent)->save();

// #6 Using the parent attribute
$node->parent_id = $parent->id;
$node->save();

// #7 Using static method
Category::create($attributes, $parent);
```

And only a couple ways to prepend:

```php
// #1
$node->prependTo($parent)->save();

// #2
$parent->prepend($node);
```

#### Inserting before or after specified node

You can make `$node` to be a neighbor of the `$neighbor` node using following methods:

*Neighbor is existing node, target node can be fresh. If target node is exists, 
it will be moved to the new position and parent will be changed if it's needed.*

```php
# Explicit save
$node->after($neighbor)->save();
$node->before($neighbor)->save();

# Implicit save
$node->insertAfter($neighbor);
$node->insertBefore($neighbor);
```

#### Shifting a node

To shift node up or down inside parent:

```php
$bool = $node->down();
$bool = $node->up();

// Shift node by 3 siblings
$bool = $node->down(3);
```

The result of the operation is boolean value of whether the node has changed the position.

#### Building a tree from array

When using static method `create` on node, it checks whether attributes contains
`children` key. If it does, it creates more nodes recursively.

```php
$node = Category::create([
    'name' => 'Foo',
    
    'children' => [
        [
            'name' => 'Bar',
            
            'children' => [
                [ 'name' => 'Baz' ],
            ],
        ],
    ],
]);
```

`$node->children` now contains a list of created child nodes.

### Retrieving nodes

In some cases we will use an `$id` variable which is an id of the target node.

#### Ancestors

```php
// #1 Using accessor
$result = $node->getAncestors();

// #2 Using a query 
$result = $node->ancestors()->get();

// #3 Getting ancestors by id of the node
$result = Category::ancestorsOf($id);
```

#### Descendants

```php
// #1 Using accessor
$result = $node->getDescendants();

// #2 Using a query 
$result = $node->descendants()->get();

// #3 Getting ancestors by id of the node
$result = Category::descendantsOf($id);
```

#### Siblings

```php
$result = $node->getSiblings();

$result = $node->siblings()->get();
```

To get just next siblings ([default order](#default-order) is applied here):

```php
// Get a sibling that is immediately after the node
$result = $node->getNextSibling();

// Get all siblings that are after the node 
$result = $node->getNextSiblings();

// Get all siblings using a query
$result = $node->nextSiblings()->get();
```

To get previous siblings ([reversed order](#default-order) is applied):

```php
// Get a sibling that is immediately before the node
$result = $node->getPrevSibling();

// Get all siblings that are before the node 
$result = $node->getPrevSiblings();

// Get all siblings using a query
$result = $node->prevSiblings()->get();
```

#### Getting related models from other table

Imagine that each category `has many` goods. I.e. `HasMany` relationship is established.
How can you get all goods of `$category` and every its descendant? Easy!

```php
// Get ids of descendants
$categories = $category->descendants()->lists('id');

// Include the id of category itself
$categories[] = $category->getKey();

// Get goods
$goods = Goods::whereIn('category_id', $categories)->get();
```

### Deleting nodes

To delete a node:

```php
$node->delete();
```

Nodes are required to be deleted as models, **don't** try do delete them using a query like so:

```php
Category::where('id', '=', $id)->delete();
```

This will brake the tree!

`SoftDeletes` trait is supported, also on model level.

### Collection extension

This package provides few helpful methods for collection of nodes. You can link nodes in plain collection like so:

```php
$result = Categories::get();

$results->linkNodes();
```

This will fill `parent` and `children` relations on every node so you can iterate over them without extra database 
requests.

To convert plain collection to tree:

```
$tree = $results->toTree();
```

`$tree` will contain only root nodes and to access children you can use `children` relation.

### Query builder extension

This packages extends default query builder to introduce few helpful features.

#### Including node depth

If you need to know at which level the node is:

```php
$result = Category::withDepth()->find($id);

$depth = $result->depth;
```

Root node will be at level 0. Children of root nodes will have a level of 1, etc.

To get nodes of specified level, you can apply `having` constraint:

```php
$result = Category::withDepth()->having('depth', '=', 1)->get();
```

#### Default order

Each node has it's own unique `_lft` value that determines its position in the tree. If
you want node to be ordered by this value, you can use `defaultOrder` method on
the query builder:

```php
// All nodes will now be ordered by lft value
$result = Category::defaultOrder()->get();
```

You can get nodes in reversed order:

```php
$result = Category::reversed()->get();
```

#### Constraints

Various constraints that can be applied to the query builder:

-   __whereIsRoot()__ to get only root nodes;
-   __hasChildren()__ to get nodes that have children;
-   __hasParent()__ to get non-root nodes;
-   __whereIsAfter($id)__ to get every node (not just siblings) that are after a node
    with specified id;
-   __whereIsBefore($id)__ to get every node that is before a node with specified id.

Descendants constraints:

```php
$result = Category::whereDescendantOf($node)->get();
$result = Category::whereDescendantOf($node)->get();
$result = Category::whereNotDescendantOf($node)->get();
$result = Category::orWhereDescendantOf($node)->get();
$result = Category::orWhereNotDescendantOf($node)->get();
```

Ancestor constraints:

```php
$result = Category::whereAncestorOf($node)->get();
```

`$node` can be either a primary key of the model or model instance.

### Node methods

Compute the number of descendants:

```php
$node->getDescendantCount();
```

To check if node is a descendant of other node:

```php
$bool = $node->isDescendantOf($parent);
```

To check whether the node is root:

```php
$bool = $node->isRoot();
```

Other checks:

*   `$node->isChildOf($other);`
*   `$node->isAncestorOf($other);`
*   `$node->isSiblingOf($other);`

### Checking consistency

You can check whether a tree is broken (i.e. has some structural errors):

```php
$bool = Category::isBroken();
```

It is possible to get error statistics:

```php
$data = Category::countErrors();
```

It will return an array with following keys:

-   `oddness` -- the number of nodes that have wrong set of `lft` and `rgt` values;
-   `duplicates` -- the number of nodes that have same `lft` or `rgt` values;
-   `wrong_parent` -- the number of nodes that have invalid `parent_id` value that
    doesn't correspond to `lft` and `rgt` values.

Requirements
------------

- PHP >= 5.4
- Laravel >= 4.1

Models are extended from new base class rather than `Eloquent`, so it's not possible
to use another framework that overrides `Eloquent`.

It is highly suggested to use database that supports transactions (like MySql's InnoDb) 
to secure a tree from possible corruption.

Installation
------------

To install the package, in terminal:

```
composer require kalnoy/nestedset
```

### Adding required columns

You can use a method to add needed columns with default names:

```php
Schema::create('table', function (Blueprint $table)
{
    ...
    NestedSet::columns($table);
});
```

To drop columns:

```php
Schema::table('table', function (Blueprint $table)
{
    NestedSet::dropColumns($table);
});
```

If, for some reasons, you want to init everything by yourself, this is preferred schema:

```php
$table->unsignedInteger('_lft');
$table->unsignedInteger('_rgt');
$table->unsignedInteger('parent_id')->nullable();

$table->index([ '_lft', '_rgt', 'parent_id' ]);
```

### The model

Your model is now extended from `Kalnoy\Nestedset\Node` class, not `Eloquent`:

```php
class Foo extends Kalnoy\Nestedset\Node {
    
}
```
