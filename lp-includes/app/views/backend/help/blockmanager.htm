            <p class="text-capitalize">The block manager in Anastasia is a place to put your content blocks and it is usually the place to start building your site.</p>
            <p class="text-info">The grids shown are mimicking your theme's layout. You can check it out by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-eye"></i> icon next to the help icon. </p>
            <p class="text-info">The block manager consists of Layouts, Sections, Grids and Blocks<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Layouts are seperated as Tabs on top of the block manager</li>
                    <li>Sections are rows of grids. Generaly, a layout is divided in 3 rows: Header,Body,Footer (but it can have more. This depends on the current theme.)</li>
                    <li>Grids are groups of blocks</li>
                    <li>Blocks are the actual content blocks</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="text-capitalize">Layouts can be created by addons, pages or the theme itself. For more information on page layouts, please visit the pages creation page and click on the help icon</p>
            <p class="text-capitalize">Sections consist of 2 types. Default sections and simple layouts. The default layouts can be changed only from the default layout.</p>
            <p class="text-capitalize">Each grid, allows you to add content blocks by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> icon. Grids are the gray boxes.</p>
            <p class="text-capitalize">Blocks (the light blue ones) are content blocks. Content blocks are created by Anastasia,addons,and themes. They are responsible for displaying content. They can be moved around by simple drag n drop and their order can be changed by changing their position number.</p>
