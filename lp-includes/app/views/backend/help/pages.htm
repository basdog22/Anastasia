               Pages in Anastasia are able to produce layouts in the block manager. As soon as you create a new page, a layout is added in the block manager. This way you can have specialized designs and layouts
              for every page. If you don't want to do this, you can set the layout each page uses.<br/>
                Pages also support nesting by their slug. A page with a slug of "documentation/theming" is considered as a child of a page with slug "documentation". This is able to produce breadcrumbs like: Documentation / Theming
