                The Dashboard Screen presents information in blocks called widgets. By default, Anastasia delivers two widgets on this page: <br/>
                The Calendar widget that displays a calendar with assigned tasks to the user and the Latest Comments widget which lists the latest 5 comments on your content.
            </p>

                Plugin or theme developers can make new Dashboard Widgets available through plugin or theme code. For more information, see the Dashboard Widgets API.
