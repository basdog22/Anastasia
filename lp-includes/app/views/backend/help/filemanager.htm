                Here, you can manage all your files. There are four predefined places: Images,Archives,Videos,Sounds and Misc.<br/>
                Each place allows only the type it is built for. You can only upload images in the Images place and video files in the Videos place. This keeps organization easy<br/>
                The filemanager is tightly synchronized with the APP Assets manager. If you upload an image, the image will be available across all the system. You can use it in your content and search for it. <br/>
